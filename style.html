<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>The "CSSU" text in the logo uses Nexa Light. All other text uses Open Sans.</p>

<h2>Colours</h2>


<h2>Logo variants</h2>
<p>Generally, the icon with the "CSSU" text superimposed on top of the emblem should be used.</p>
<p>In cases where a single hue is needed, use the full (horizontal) variant, as that allows for both the text and emblem to be shown.</p>
<p>The "retro" variant is also provided, based on the original logo from 1981.</p>

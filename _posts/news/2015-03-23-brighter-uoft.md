As many of you are aware the UTSU elections are currently underway. For a long time computer scientists have felt, and rightly so, that they’ve been inadequately represented by student government. I’ve personally had the opportunity to chat with Ben Coleman and the rest of the Brighter UofT team and I can confidently say they are aware of our issues and will work to address them. On that note we are proud to formally endorse [Brighter UofT](http://brighteruoft.ca/). Votes are in person and online on March 24th, 25th, and 26th. Make sure you vote and to vote for a [Brighter UofT](http://brighteruoft.ca/).

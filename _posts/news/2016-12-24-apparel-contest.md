Are ugly Christmas sweaters really making you think about why we don't have our own ugly CS sweaters? Have a sweet t-shirt/hoodie design idea that you want to see come to fruition? This is your chance to make it happen!

We're running a CS apparel design contest this year, where the winner(s) will receive a t-shirt and hoodie for free.

- Submit your t-shirt and/or hoodie designs by Sunday, January 29th at 11:59pm. Multiple submissions are allowed.
- Voting will be open to the public on Tuesday, January 31st.

We'll be working with the winner to get their designs approved by the department (if the designs contain DCS branding). T-shirts/hoodies will be available for sale in late February.

[Submit your designs here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8qg28tzOPTJyci-kB77HM-UAqpYe5pwbh_I2tXqN1tnYKBw/viewform).

*Voting will be available on Jan 31st.*

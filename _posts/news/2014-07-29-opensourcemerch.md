[Open Source Merch](http://opensourcemerch.com) is a new small business started by Lia Zheng, a fellow student in the UofT CS department.
They sell stickers of some of your favourite open source projects (Git, Linux, VLC, etc.) and are available for sale in the office. CSSU members can get a 10% discount on cash purchases over $10. You can order online and arrange to pick it up in the office, see their [FAQ](https://open-source-merch.myshopify.com/pages/faq) for more details.

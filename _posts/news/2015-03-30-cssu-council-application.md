Applications for appointed positions on next year's CSSU Council are now open! You have until April 13th at 11:59pm to submit your application!
Being on the council is an extremely rewarding experience and gives you a chance to give back to students in the CS department, whether it's through helping plan an academic seminar, using your graphic design skills to make a great poster, or organizing a social event like a pub night!

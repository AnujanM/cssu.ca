Have questions about POST? Wondering what resources are available for you? Want to know more about the CS program?

Join us on March 2nd in BA1200 from 5PM - 7PM for a conversation with several faculty members of the Department of Computer Science and get your questions answered.

This is your chance to ask any questions you have about CS at UofT. This could include questions on courses, study spaces, research opportunities, or program requirements. Take this time to share any concerns effecting your experience and make your voice heard! Our objective is to generate discussion and gather input for the continued improvement of DCS.

So get your questions ready and don't forget to drop by!

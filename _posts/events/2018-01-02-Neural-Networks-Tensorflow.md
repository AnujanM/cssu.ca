The CSSU is proud to welcome TorontoAI to UofT! TorontoAI (torontoai.org) will be presenting a seminar on how to implement neural networks in TensorFlow.

Professor Sanja Fidler will also be in attendance to talk about some of her work in the field of AI. Learn more about what she does [here](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/)

This is intended to be both a high level introduction as well as an exploration of applied techniques so consider bringing your laptop to follow along!

NOTE: Student ID will be required with tickets at the door. If you are not a student please [click here](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-AI/events/245997433/) for alternative admission.

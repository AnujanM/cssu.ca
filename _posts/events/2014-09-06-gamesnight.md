To go along with our first ever CS Frosh Day (Reminder you can apply to be a frosh leader at http://cssu.ca/froshleaders/ until August 16th) we're having our first Games Night following it and it's before the school year even starts! It won't be going all night (It's ending at midnight) but it will be a great opportunity to meet up with all your friends from you've missed over the summer and to see the incoming first years! Hope to see you there! https://www.facebook.com/events/165836586950220/?context=create&source=49

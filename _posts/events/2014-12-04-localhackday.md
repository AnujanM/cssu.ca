**Note:** We're currently sold out, we're in the progress of trying to find more slots so more people can attend. Please stay tuned.

On December 6th students from around the world will be participating in MLH's Local Hack Day and the CSSU will be hosting it here at UofT! Come by and check it out in SM2360 from 9am to 9pm, there will be plenty of space, plenty of whiteboards and all the tools needed to make an awesome hack. I hope everyone can make it!
